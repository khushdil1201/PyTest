The :fixture:`pytester` fixture now uses the :fixture:`monkeypatch` fixture to manage the current working directory.
If you use ``pytester`` in combination with :func:`monkeypatch.undo() <pytest.MonkeyPatch.undo>`, the CWD might get restored.
Use :func:`monkeypatch.context() <pytest.MonkeyPatch.context>` instead.
